          The DORA Community was formally launched with the release of the 2022
          Accelerate State of DevOps Report, almost a year ago. The community
          includes practitioners, leaders, and researchers interested in
          learning more about and sharing their experiences with driving high
          performance in technology-driven organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DORA Community includes four Community Guides who help create a 
          welcoming, inclusive environment for everyone while also shaping the 
          future of the community.  Denali Lumma, DORA Community Guide, will 
          share her experience with the DORA Community including insights into 
          the value of community and how you can get involved.
