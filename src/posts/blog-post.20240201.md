Hello! Thank you for all of the wonderful discussions in January! It was exciting to meet several members for the first time. We discussed what teams are focused on in 2024, Metrics, and Applying DORA in your Context. If you missed any of the discussions, you can watch intro presentations, and read event recaps on the DORA.community blog.

We will continue to explore how team‚Äôs can improve their code reviews, with a presentation by Daniel Izquierdo Cort√°zar and community discussion Thursday, February 8th. On February 22nd, we will have a community discussion on testing, the discussion will start with a presentation by Lisa Crispin. If you are looking to connect with fellow DORA community members, this month‚Äôs community connection is on February 14th. We will end the month with Metric Monday discussions on February 26th. More information on the events are below.

**Open Discussion on Code Review Use Cases** - February 8th: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240208T150000&p1=43&p2=1440&p3=136&p4=tz_pt&p5=196&p6=248" target="_blank"> 15:00</a> UTC

Code review is essential in software development nowadays. This brings certain advantages to the organization producing code (it does not matter if this is done in the open or internally as proprietary), such as better knowledge sharing process, faster onboarding of newcomers, make the organization more resilient, or help hunt bugs faster in the software production chain.

This talk will share some public use cases and rationale to do code review with real-life examples for illustration as well as open the discussion for the rest of the hour together.

**Testing All the Way Around the DevOps Loop** - February 22nd: <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240222T200000&p1=43&p2=1440&p3=136&p4=tz_pt&p5=196&p6=248" target="_blank"> 20:00</a> UTC
We hear a lot of talk about ‚Äúshift left‚Äù in testing. And, if you do an internet search for ‚ÄúDevOps loop‚Äù, you‚Äôre likely to see images that feature a ‚Äútest‚Äù phase ‚Äì sometimes on the left side, sometimes on the right. But software development is not linear, and testing is not a phase. Testing is an integral part of software development. Testing activities happen all the way around the infinite DevOps loop. Let‚Äôs look at examples of where testing happens, especially in
the right-hand side of that DevOps loop. And, talk about who can and should engage in those activities.

**Speaker**:
Lisa Crispin is an independent consultant, author and speaker based in Vermont, USA. Together with Janet Gregory, she co-authored Holistic Testing: Weave Quality Into Your
Product; Agile Testing Condensed: A Brief Introduction; More Agile Testing: Learning Journeys for the Whole Team; and Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams; and the LiveLessons ‚ÄúAgile Testing Essentials‚Äù video course. She and Janet co-founded a training company offering two live courses world-wide: ‚ÄúHolistic Testing: Strategies for agile teams‚Äù and ‚ÄúHolistic Testing for Continuous Delivery‚Äù.

continuous delivery. She‚Äôs active in the DORA community of practice.
