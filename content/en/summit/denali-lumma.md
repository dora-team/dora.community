<h3>Guide to the DORA Community</h3>

<p>
The DORA Community was formally launched with the release of the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report, almost a year ago.  The community includes practitioners, leaders, and researchers interested in learning more about and sharing their experiences with driving high performance in technology-driven organizations.

The DORA Community includes four Community Guides who help create a welcoming, inclusive environment for everyone while also shaping the future of the community.  Denali Lumma, DORA Community Guide, will share her experience with the DORA Community including insights into the value of community and how you can get involved.
