<h3>How DORA influenced John Deere's Agile Operating Model</h3>

<p>
In <a href="https://videos.itrevolution.com/watch/778295505/" target="_blanK">our DOES 2022 talk</a>, we shared how we successfully transformed ~500 global technology teams over three years, in adopting Agility & DevOps, shifting from projects to products, and promoting a generative organizational culture. In this talk, we'll double-click into how DORA influenced our transformation, from informing how we measured overall success to guiding where to focus our coaching and transformation efforts.
